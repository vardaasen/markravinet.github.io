# Welcome to my github repository

I am an evolutionary biologist based at the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis at the University of Oslo, Norway. I work on evolutionary, speciation and population genomics. You can find a bit more about me [here](http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/people/researcher-postdoc/msravine/) and see some of my work [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=GfpvKBwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

## EVOP 2018 exercises

The updated EVOP exercises for the NGS for non-model organisms module of the 2018 [Programming for Evolutionary Biology course in Berlin](http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/?page_id=7), Germany are available here.

- [Reference-mapped RAD analysis with sticklebacks](exercise_1_reference_2018.md)
- [_denovo_ assembly RAD analaysis with cichlids](exercise_2_denovo_2018.md)

I have also added some [additional notes and information](extra_notes_2018.md)

## EVOP 2017 exercises

The exercises I wrote for NGS for non-model organisms module of the 2017 [Programming for Evolutionary Biology course in Leipzig](http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/?page_id=7), Germany are available here.

- [Reference-mapped RAD analysis with sticklebacks](exercise_1_reference.md)
- [_denovo_ assembly RAD analaysis with cichlids](exercise_2_denovo.md)

## CEES Pop Genomics workshop

Some pointers for tips and tricks are available [here](CEES_tips_&_tricks.md)

A guide to setting thresholds for GATK filters is [here](https://markravinet.github.io/sparrow_SNP_thresholds.html)

## Slightly less serious

I would highly, highly recommend [this](http://musicforprogramming.net/) as a way to break through the drudgery of coding.
